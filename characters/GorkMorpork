Gork Morpork
============
Orc Police Deputy.
Introduce orc society and motivations.

Gork woke up grumpy, quickly sits up in his slime pot, to have a look around the nourishing chamber.
 most of the slime pots he sees are empty, and he sees Umbar running for the rinsing station. Umbar pulls
 the lever, smiles and looks over to Gork and says the equivalent of "Ahahaha enjoy cleaning the slime puddles Mork".

  *Most of the sounds in the orc language is in the frequency range of a human ear, but since they have no resperatory
their communication uses alot of body language and sounds. The do have an empty chamber in what would be the neck of a human,
that's where their more advanced sounds are. But you'll be surprised how far varying noise levels of screaming and beating your
chest will get you in orc society*

Gork gets out of bed. He feels like being slime cleaner has been falling alot on him lately. But he has been doing well
in the games and his boss he is top behind the current leader Nahgar. His boss doesn't like him very much but he heard boss boss bet
on him in the last brawl and boss boss boss even said his name once. He thinks he has a good chance of winning this
big cycle tournament, and then boss boss boss would surely choose him for becoming leutenant. Becoming leutenand doesn't
mean you get another implant, but you get your first grunt to command, become a boss.
