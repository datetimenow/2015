  text: "The loud phone ring disturbs Orvilles podcast on her way home from work. She quickly pulls the headphones out of her ears.
  She still hasn't figured out how to lower the ringtone on the phone, while it's connected to headphones.
  She isn't normally the kind of person who delays things, but she has long decided that receiving calls and email was all she needs from this modern contraption.
  It's the white house secretary calling
  O - Orville speaking
  S - Hello Orville, I hope I am not disturbing, are you watching the broadcast?
  O - No, I just left the office
  S - There has been a UFO sighted entering the solar system, you are wanted back at work as soon as possible, there is a meeting in meeting room 2
  O - I will be right there

  It's on all the tv's in the office. Pictures from the Hubble telescope confirm without any doubt that this is indeed an enourmous alien spacecraft. She goes to her office and puts away her things,
  there is already a short briefing on her desk. She sits down and quickly reads through it before heading to the meeting room. It's an enormous spherical spacecraft, with a diameter the size of a small country.
  A radio telescope picked up a signal a few hours ago, and it didn't take long for all the telescopes on this side of the planet to point towards the source. With its current speed it should be here within a fortnight.

  The meeting room is half empty, she takes a seat
  Chief of Staff -
