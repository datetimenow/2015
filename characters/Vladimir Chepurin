Labor crisis

Unemployment rampant, homeless people given food and shelter for a few hours of community work per day.

A girl hearing voices in her head, she says that everyone in her cult is hearing the voices, and that it is connected to an augmented spinal implant she they are all wearing. 

There is an upcoming election and the main topic is augmented spinal implants

The workers party wins the election narrowly. They were for freedom of augmentation. 

Economy is doing well, with brain implant industry booming. Out of the countries where it is legal it has the highest number of users. 

Vladimir runs for re-election but he hardly comes on any media, and when he does, nobody listens. The peoples party win by a landslide

Becomes active in resistance movement
